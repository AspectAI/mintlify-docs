An Anagram **Experience** is an AI-powered app that you can embed on your website. An experience can be anything from a product recommender, to a location finder, to a lead qualifier. It's the conversation, the dynamic interface elements, and all the actions that happen along the way.

## What makes an experience

Every Experience has two core components:

**Outline:** Your written instructions that guide how the AI should behave, what tone to use, and what it should focus on. This is where you set the boundaries and personality for your agent.

**Skills:** The specific actions your agent can take, like recommending products, applying discounts, scheduling appointments, or collecting survey responses. Skills can connect to other platforms to retrieve data or perform actions, and each experience can use different combinations of Skills.

## Experience examples

- **Product Finder:** Helps customers find the right product through conversation, generates visual comparisons, and applies relevant discounts.
- **Lead Qualifier:** Asks smart questions to identify good prospects, collects contact information, and routes leads to your sales team.
- **Interactive Survey:** Gathers customer feedback through dynamic questions that adapt based on previous answers.
- **Support Assistant:** Answers common questions, troubleshoots issues, and escalates to human agents when needed.

## How visitors interact

When a visitor starts an Experience, they're not filling out a form or clicking through a decision tree. They're having a conversation that feels natural and helpful. The AI generates buttons, sliders, cards, and other interface elements on the fly based on what each customer needs. Every Experience is designed to feel like talking to a helpful expert who happens to have superpowers.
