**Skills** are the specific actions your AI agent can take during a conversation. They give the experience the ability to do things like retrieve data or perform an action in another platform. Each Skill is a self-contained capability that knows exactly what it does, when it should be used, and what information it needs to work properly.

## How skills work

Skills operate independently and can be mixed and matched in any experience. When you enable a skill, the AI agent automatically knows how and when to use it based on the conversation context and the outline you defined for the experience. For example, if you enable the "Recommend Product" skill, the agent will use the conversation context to understand your visitor's preferences, search your product catalog to find the best products to recommend, and display cards with each recommended product, including images and buttons to buy the product.

## Enabling and configuring skills

Individual skills can be enabled for each experience and configured independently. This gives you the ability to taylor an experience for a specific use case. For example, a gift guide could use the Recommend Product skill, while a location finder may not have Recommend Product enabled, and instead have data added about retail locations that carry your products.Each skill comes with its own settings that you customize for your needs.

## Skills in action

Your AI agent orchestrates Skills seamlessly during conversations. It uses skills to gather the information it needs to respond to user messages or perform actions to carry out a user request. A user might trigger multiple skills in one conversation. The user never sees the individual skills working. They just experience helpful, intelligent assistance that can actually get things done.
