To create great experiences, Anagram experiences often need to access data, use tools, and perform actions. They can do these things using skills. The _Skills_ tab in the Studio allows you to enable these abilities for your experience.

## Enabling a skill

The _Skills_ tab includes a list of skills that can be enabled. Some skills connect to third-part platforms (for example, to search a Shopify product catalog). Others use Anagram's data hub. To enable a skill, click the toggle on the skill card.

## Configuring a skill

Clicking on a skill card allows you to configure the skill. Each skill has its own configuration options. Skill configuration only applies when a skill is being used. Other parts of the experience don't have access to the skill configuration.

## When skills are used

The experience agent decides when to use a skill. To influence the agent that it should use a skill at a particular time, you can put instructions in the outline. For example, you could add something like, "Ask 3-5 questions, and then make a product recommendation" to the experience outline in the _Outline_ tab.

The experience agent will also try to use skills whenever they seem relevant to the situation. For example, if a user says, "Can you recommend a backpack that can fit a 13" laptop and has a water bottle pocket?", the agent can call the _Make Product Recommendations_ skill itself.
