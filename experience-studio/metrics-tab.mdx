To see how users are interacting with your experience, click the Metrics tab. This will show several graphs and data points, depending on which integrations and skills you have set up. These metrics are for this experience specifically and don't include other experiences in your Anagram project.

## Metrics definitions

Here are some definitions of metrics you'll see on this page.

**Engagements:** An engagement is defined as a single use of an experience. For example, if a user uses the product recommender experience on your site, answers five questions, and receives a recommendation, that whole set of interactions together counts as one engagement. If the user comes back a day later and does it again, that would count as a separate engagement.

**Assisted sales:** This is the total dollar amount of sales to customers in the same session they used your experience, capped at a 24-hour window. For example, if a shopper used an experience to get a product recommended to them and then checked out 10 minutes later, that checkout would count as an assisted sale. If they then came back two days later and bought another product (without using an Anagram experience first), that would _not_ count as an assisted sale. This metric is only available if you have the Anagram pixel installed on your site (through the Shopify app, for example).

**AOV:** Average order value. This is the average dollar amount of sales per checkout. This is specifically for Anagram-assisted sales. This metric is only available if you have the Anagram pixel installed on your site (through the Shopify app, for example).

**Anagram conversion rate:** This is the percentage of users who completed checkout after using Anagram, capped at a 24-hour window. This metric is only available if you have the Anagram pixel installed on your site (through the Shopify app, for example).
