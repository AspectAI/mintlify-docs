A Location Finder helps customers quickly find the nearest store, dealer, or service location, right from your site. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to create one end-to-end, from setting up your locations to publishing the experience.

You’ll be done in just a few minutes.

---

## Step 1: Go to the Data Hub

Start by navigating to the **Data Hub**.\
This is where all shared datasets live, including locations.

## Step 2: Create a Location Set

Click **Create Location Set**.

A **Location Set** is the collection of locations your Location Finder runs on. Think of it as the source of truth for every store or place the experience can recommend.

---

## Step 3: Add Locations to the Set

In the Location Set creation modal, you’ll see two ways to add locations:

### Option 1: Upload a CSV

If you’re coming from another location tool (like Locally), you can export your locations as a CSV and upload it here.

This is the fastest option if you already have structured location data.

### Option 2: Add Locations Manually

You can also search for and add locations directly inside the UI.

This works great if you have a smaller number of locations or want to build the set incrementally.

> **Missed a location?**\
> No problem. After the Location Set is created, you can click into it at any time and use the **Add Locations** button at the top to search for and add more.

## Step 4: Create the Location Finder Experience

Once your Location Set is ready, head back to the **Home** page.

Click **Create Experience**.

---

## Step 5: Choose the Location Finder Template

You’ll see a **Location Finder** template available.

Select it.

This template automatically configures several things for you so you can get started faster, including:

- A clear goal
- A basic Guildlines
- The right skills enabled by default

You can customize everything later, but this gives you a strong starting point.

---

## Step 6: Connect Your Location Set

You’re almost done.

Open your new Experience and go to:

**Skills → Location Finder**

Make sure the correct **Location Set** is selected. This tells the experience which locations it should search and recommend.

---

## Step 7: Preview and Publish

Use the **Preview** to test the experience and make sure it behaves the way you expect.

When you’re happy:

- Click **Publish** at the top
- Copy the embed code
- Add it to your site

Your Location Finder is now live.

---

## Step 8: Track Performance

After publishing, you can monitor how the experience is performing by visiting the **Metrics** tab on the Experience.

You’ll be able to see how users interact with it and how often locations are being found.

---

That’s it.\
You’ve created, published, and launched a Location Finder experience.
