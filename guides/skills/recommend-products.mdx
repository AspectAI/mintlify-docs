The **Recommend Products** skill lets Anagram suggest the right products from your catalog—automatically, and in real conversations with users. It works by grounding the agent in your real product data, so recommendations are relevant, accurate, and actually purchasable.

## **Before you start: Set up your product catalog**

Before enabling this skill, Anagram needs access to a product catalog. You set this up in the **Data Hub**. There are a couple ways to set up a product catalog:

- Connect an e-commerce integration
- Upload a product CSV (coming soon)

### **Option 1: Connect an ecommerce integration**

If you’re using a platform like **Shopify**, you can connect to it directly with an integration. Anagram will automatically pull in your products and keep them up to date.

### **Option 2: Upload a product CSV (coming soon)**

If your products aren't in a platform that Anagram currently integrates with, you can upload a CSV of your products instead. [******This feature is in closed beta and will be rolled out to all users soon. Reach out via email to support@anagram.ai if you're interested in using it.******](mailto:support@anagram.ai)

> Important note: You can’t mix an integration (like Shopify) and a CSV catalog in the same project.

## **Enable the recommend products skill**

Once your catalog is set up:

1. Open the **Experience Editor**
2. Go to the **Skills** tab
3. Enable the **Recommend Products** skill

## **Guide the agent's recommendations**

### Filter rules

You can add **filter rules** to limit which products Anagram is allowed to recommend. For example, you can filter Shopify catalogs by collections, tags, or metafields. This is useful if you want Anagram to only recommend products from certain categories.

### Recommendation guidelines

You can also add **recommendation guidelines** — plain-English instructions that help shape how the agent behaves. Use guidelines to emphasize certain types of products for specific preferences or help the agent understand nuances of your product catalog. You can think of this like training an in-store sales associate on how to recommend your products.

## **How it comes together**

When a user asks for help choosing a product, Anagram:

1. Understands what the user is looking for
2. Searches for relevant products that match your filters
3. Follows your guidelines
4. Recommends the best-fit products from your catalog

The result feels personal and helpful — without sending users off to browse endless product pages.
